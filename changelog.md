### EIA.CISO and EIA.PJM data anomalies

Thanks to the help of an eagle-eyed API user, we've corrected two issues with EIA data. First, there is a 10-month period during which CAISO failed to report the "hydro" and "other" fuel types to the EIA:

We've amended EIA.CISO data during this period with "hydro" and "other" values from direct CAISO data.

In addition, EIA.CISO and EIA.PJM data appears to be consistently one hour behind direct data from CAISO and PJM. We believe these two ISOs are reporting correct data through their own APIs and dashboards, but submitting to the EIA with the wrong timestamps, causing the mismatch. We've timeshifted EIA.CISO and EIA.PJM to correct the  issue, and we'll continue working with the EIA to identify any other regions that may be affected by this.

#### Improvements and fixes:
- Forecast lookahead monitors on the [status page](https://carbonara.singularity.energy/status) now show the correct colors
- Removed imports from CAISO generated fuel mix for consistency with other ISOs
- Improved data quality of CAISO and SPP generated fuel mix
